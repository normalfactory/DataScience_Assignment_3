Repo contains the files for the "python challenge".   
  
#### PyBank
The solution to this problem uses three python files.  The PyBank_Data.py contains a single class, 
ResultContainer, that is used to store the results during the processing of the financial records.
The PyBank_Processing.py contains the functions used for the processing.  
  
The main.py is the script that is to be used to start the processing; it calls the PyBank_Processing.py.
  
  
#### PyPoll
The solution uses two python files.  The PyPoll_Processing.py contains the functions to do the calculations.
A dictionary is used in this solution to transfer the results of the calculations to the different functions.  
  
The main.py is the script used to start the processing.
